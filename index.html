        <strong>Musical innovation or degradation?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sampling - today one of the most popular and powerful tools in music
        production at first interpreted simply as stealing. Nowadays consider as
        a way to push a new life into the old classics. Invented in the middle
        70's now at it's pick of popularity: used wordwide by artist
        representing almost every possible genre. Method of sampling involves
        "borrowing" a section of audio track- and then reinventing, panipulating
        and changing for your own music purpose. Some musicans are still
        strongly convinced it's only a shameless and easy way of plagiarism,
        others that it's a form of art that requires high level of creativity
        and developed imagination or forward thinking.
